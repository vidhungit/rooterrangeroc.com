In this example, the procedure ends when j equals 6: This example uses a WHILE statement to iterate through FETCH and SET statements.  The SQL Server @@ROWCOUNT system variable can be used also to control the loop and stop it when the number of rows matches the specified condition reach a specific value, rescuing it from falling in an infinite loop.  True or False.  The following figure shows a valid WHILE condition.  The LOOP structure handles this requirement nicely.  Notes.
