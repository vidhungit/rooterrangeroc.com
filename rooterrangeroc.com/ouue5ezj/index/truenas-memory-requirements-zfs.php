A vdev is a top-level RAID “virtual device” compromising one or more drives.  TrueNAS supports a ZFS Write Log function which makes the system very reliable even during power failures.  If you're after efficiency, the old ZFS guidance is to set vdev width so your quantity of data disks is an even power of 2 is still valid (so for RAIDZ2, that's 3w, 6w, 10w, 18w, etc).
