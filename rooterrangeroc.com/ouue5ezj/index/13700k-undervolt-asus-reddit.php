Next scroll all the way down to system agent voltage.  My old 12700 used about 1. 13.  13700k undervolt question.  ASUS Z790P Prime Wifi.  Overwatch 50-67w. 02 offset, you start loosing performance in cinebench r23.  P2 cores x53: 5.  Yes, Intel has the best IPC on the market at the moment but there is an associated cost with that other than just the purchase price. 110 is completely fine. 18 etc.  I've read about the B-chipset-boards having problems with VRM heating.  On my first motherboard it says 1.  ASUS TUF Gaming Z690-PLUS WiFi D4 LGA 1700 ATX Motherboard Corsair H115i ELITE CAPELLIX XT Thermalright LGA1700-BCF Intel Core i7-13700K Processor And fyi, I'd like to undervolt to draw less power and keep fan noise lower if possible.  I got the most stable cpu voltage around 1,280V.  good luck in this day and age of motherboard prices.  Technically, undervolting your CPU while maintaining the original frequency is considered as overclock. 1. <br><br><BR><UL><LI><a href=https://industrialpropertylease.com/k3k2ubkt/stanley-consultants-phoenix.html>stanley consultants phoenix</a></LI><LI><a href=https://industrialpropertylease.com/k3k2ubkt/audi-a4-intake-manifold-runner-position-sensor.html>audi a4 intake manifold runner position sensor</a></LI><LI><a href=https://industrialpropertylease.com/k3k2ubkt/huggingface-whisper-example.html>huggingface whisper example</a></LI><LI><a href=https://industrialpropertylease.com/k3k2ubkt/nvidia-wayland-gnome.html>nvidia wayland gnome</a></LI><LI><a href=https://industrialpropertylease.com/k3k2ubkt/stiletto-switchblade-push-button.html>stiletto switchblade push button</a></LI><LI><a href=https://industrialpropertylease.com/k3k2ubkt/peter-paragraph-examples.html>peter paragraph examples</a></LI><LI><a href=https://industrialpropertylease.com/k3k2ubkt/best-chinese-restaurant-newcastle.html>best chinese restaurant newcastle</a></LI><LI><a href=https://industrialpropertylease.com/k3k2ubkt/change-in-momentum-calculator.html>change in momentum calculator</a></LI><LI><a href=https://industrialpropertylease.com/k3k2ubkt/skyrim-vampire-class-guide.html>skyrim vampire class guide</a></LI><LI><a href=https://industrialpropertylease.com/k3k2ubkt/nec-craft-show-november-2023-dates.html>nec craft show november 2023 dates</a></LI></UL><br><br></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub>
