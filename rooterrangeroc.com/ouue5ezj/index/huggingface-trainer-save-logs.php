However, I'm encountering a number of issues.  Under distributed environment this is done only for a process with rank 0.  The Trainer should pick up that there is already a wandb process running and so will just log to that process instead of spinning up a .  Pre-process the data set.  Since you display in epochs now, I can only assume that 1st epoch is equal to 100 steps, starting from 0 steps and once it reaches the 6th epoch is starts to display the logs. init before kicking off your training, see wandb.  Callbacks are objects that can customize the behavior of the training loop in the PyTorch Trainer (this feature is not yet implemented in TensorFlow) that can inspect the training loop state (for progress reporting, logging on TensorBoard or other ML platforms) and take decisions (like early stopping). train() and also tested it with trainer. from_pretrained 1 Answer.  It then uses PyTorch to perform the forward and backward passes during training, and to update the model's weights using the optimizer.  Hugging Face interfaces well with MLflow and automatically logs metrics during model training using the MLflowCallback.  Transformers version v4.  You can find the complete list Now simply call trainer.  Callbacks are ‚Äúread only‚Äù pieces of code, apart However, I found that Trainer class of huggingface-transformers saves all the checkpoints that I set, where I can set the maximum number of checkpoints to save.
