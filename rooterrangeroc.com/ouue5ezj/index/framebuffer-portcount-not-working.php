You can load it, if you have it available, with the commands modprobe vesafb.  You might try changing that to GL_RGBA16F and seeing if that works.  Use the framebuffer console.  Kernel Mode Setting (KMS)&#182; Drivers must initialize the mode setting core by calling drmm_mode_config_init() on the DRM device.  VirtualBox is in constant development and new features are implemented continuously.  So, for example, a common 16 bit display with resolution 480 x 272 will take up 480x272x16/8 bytes = 261120 bytes.  3.  Mistakes related to measuring Performance.  0.  If none is available for your graphics card, you can use the generic VESA driver, but this requires an additional parameter to be passed to the kernel at boot time.  Stack Exchange Network.  I've been trying to get shadow mapping to work , but the the It doesnâ€™t seem to work as expected which is that it should Blit the framebuffer too the other framebuffer which I setup with glReadBuffer(GL_FRONT); If you don't have a dGPU (NVidia/ATI dedicated graphics) you can skip this part and jump straight to configuring your display adapter instead. How should I fix it? I do not follow the installation guides as they lead to some other errors and finally they stop. g.  Enables WhateverGreen's patching mechanism.  What is the right way to use?
