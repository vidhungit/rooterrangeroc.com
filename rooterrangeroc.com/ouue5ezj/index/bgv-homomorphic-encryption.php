This large dimension is needed because of the large modulus-to-noise ratio in the key-switching matrices that are used for the top few levels of the evaluated circuit.  N +1) with N a power of 2.  Applications of homomorphic encryption include privacy-preserving machine learning, private information search, and electronic voting.  The BGV homomorphic encryption scheme was proposed by Brakerski, Gentry and Vaikuntanathan in 2012 and is implemented in the HElib and PALISADE libraries.

HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION PRIMER Homomorphic encryption comes in three distinct forms that each have their own set of pros and cons.  Such bit-level arithmetic is universal, but requires many Boolean The importance of this last property stems from the fact that a valid ciphertext in a BGV-type homomorphic encryption scheme must have a low noise, namely its inner-product with the unknown secret key must be a low-norm polynomial.
