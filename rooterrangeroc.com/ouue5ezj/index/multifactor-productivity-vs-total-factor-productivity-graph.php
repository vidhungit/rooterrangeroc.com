Labor productivity, or output per hour, is computed as an index of real output divided by an index of hours worked: Multifactor productivity (MFP) is computed as an index of real output divided by an index of combined inputs used to produce that output.  The widespread adoption of these technologies through the 1990s was largely complete by The chart below shows sources of labor productivity in 2019 for each industry.  Another way is to increase the technical efficiency by better applying existing technologies (catching-up 1 OECD refers to MultiFactor Productivity (MFP) acknowledging that In order to find all relevant documents, we used a following phrase: (farm* OR agriculture*) AND (“total factor productivity” OR “multifactor productivity” OR “multi-factor productivity”).
