With those you have to watch out though, because when you alias a YAML mapping (loaded as a Python dict), that you will get the same instance of that dict attached to item1 and item2.  In order to support the best available YAML editing capability (so called, round-trip editing with support for comment preservation), this project is based on ruamel.
