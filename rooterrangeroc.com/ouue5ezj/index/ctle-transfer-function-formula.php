Formula for equalization of eye diagram with a Continuous Time Linear Equalizer transfer function. S.  For the Rx CTLE block, set the FilterMethod to Cascaded to accommodate repeated poles as detailed in the PCIe Gen5 Base Specification (Equation 8-7). FFE System object™ applies a feed-forward equalizer (FFE) as a symbol-spaced finite-impulse response (FIR) filter.  The amount of equalization is given by the A technical report from UC Berkeley EECS department that presents a novel design of a low-power, high-speed decision feedback equalizer (DFE) for serial links.  The DFE input is taken from the output of the CTLE and its a CTLE limitation.  C.

RX Continuous-Time Linear Equalizer (CTLE) Both linear passive and active filters can realize high-pass transfer function to compensate for channel loss as shown in Figure 7.  The DC gain for each input-output pair is returned.  At frequencies above filter resonance, Vo becomes much smaller than VL, and the second term may be omitted.  R.  The DFE acts as a filter that uses feedback with a certain transfer function to estimate the response of the channel.  The inverting path with coefﬁcient a subtracts from the low-pass noninverting path, resulting in a programmable right-half plane (RHP) zero.  You can define the CTLE In this video I will explain how to take transfer function data representing the frequency response of a Continuous Time Linear Equalizer, or CTLE, and transform it into a Gain Pole Zero, or GPZ, matrix that can be loaded into the SerDes The Continuous Time Linear Equalizer operator is a transfer function defined by DC gain, zero frequency, and two or three poles.

We control the resistance R s by eight signals, thus .  The s-domain transfer function, H(s), for a CTLE with n zeros and m poles is defined as follows: The SerDes Toolbox CTLE is configured through a GPZ matrix, so a method is required for extracting the poles and zeros from the transfer function information.  Adjust preprocess options for your transfer function data.  To add a custom analysis function to fit the CTLE transfer function to a rational function, select the signals /outp and /outn and then click the Add Analysis button in the app toolstrip. : 2: adapt: If WaveType is set to 'Impulse' or 'Waveform', then the Init subsystem calls to the serdes.

A DFE is a non-linear equalizer that is used to compensate for the limited performance of the CTLE.  Similar to the conventional CTLE, capacitive source degeneration adds an extra pole and a zero to the transfer function thereby giving a high pass response. 4-Gb/s DisplayPort Receivers in 28-nm UTBB-FDSOI Paramjeet Singh Sahni, Suresh Chandra Joshi, Nitin Gupta, and .
