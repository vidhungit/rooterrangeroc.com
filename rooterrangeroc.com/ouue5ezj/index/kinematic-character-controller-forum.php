Now he is able to detect the ground and adjust movement according to the steep angle, preventing sliding along it into the sky.  This setting is useful to disable an object's physics temporarily (to reposition it, say) or to allow raycasts or other physics engine effects that need a rigidbody to work.  The well-known move-and-slide operation is the main feature of a character controller.  You should also be able to rotate it, it's not axis aligned, but you'll need to code your own ground checking.
