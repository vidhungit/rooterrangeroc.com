Here are 13 public repositories matching this topic.  Author. 2 steps = 38mm linear movement. 62 2022-05-22 Added link to AccelStepper - The Missing Manual.  The use case for this is: With this library AccelStepper can be used to control steppers using a MCP23017 I/O Expander over I2C interface.  When controlled by setting position, the stepper will accelerate to move at this maximum speed, and decelerate as it .  Device Control.  Website.  Here is a simple code to get TMC2209 working with basic functionalities.  The motor interface type must be set to 1 when using a step and direction driver.  The next step is to define the DRV8825 to Arduino connections and the motor interface type.  Parent: 0:a0391774b0e5.
