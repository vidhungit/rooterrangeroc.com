The device uses an 8n-prefetch architecture to achieve high-speed oper-ation.  The DIMM slots are paired and the DIMMs must be installed in pairs (0-1, 2-3, 4-5, and 6-7).  I bought a second SO-DIMM for my Dell Latitude 5420 and want to check if the RAM works in dual-channel mode now.

RAM DIMM sticks are fairly standard and well-designed: they can only be inserted one way on both desktops and laptops, desktop and laptop RAM isn't interchangeable, and different generations of RAM won't fit in the wrong socket (so a motherboard that only supports DDR4 RAM can't Here is the formula we’ll use for true memory latency: True memory latency (ns) = (2000/RAM Speed) (ns) x CAS latency.  Because of the new bit path, DIMMs can be installed one at a time, unlike SIMMs (single inline memory modules) that Rank 就好像逻辑 DIMM 。我们可以把原本两根物理DIMM的内存颗粒全部安装在一块内存印刷电路板上，使得一根内存条具备两倍的内存容量。我们把这种逻辑 DIMM 称为 Rank 。为了支持多 RANK 的内存条，我们需要在物理 DIMM 接口上定义多个 CS_N 片选信号以便可以选择 . 068249] ffff88027c533fd8 ffff88027c533fd8 ffff8826eff68000 ffff88027c533d58 [90620196. 2 V Unbuffered DIMM (UDIMM) DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4 and DDR5 all have different pin counts and/or different notch positions.
