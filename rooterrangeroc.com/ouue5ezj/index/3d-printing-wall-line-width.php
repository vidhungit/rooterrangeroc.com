One of the most important considerations when designing parts for 3D printing in 2022 is the 3D printing wall thickness, sometimes referred to as the wall thickness. 11. 2mm (80-120% of nozzle diameter) Wall Thickness: 1mm, 2mm, or 3mm (multiple of 1mm nozzle size) Print Speed: 30-35mm/s; .  It calls to question whether the shell thickness is actually a physical dimension for the 3D print or just a parameter for the slicer engine.  You can easily calculate it by dividing the print’s Wall Thickness with the Wall Line Width.  Wall loops x nozzle diameter doesn't work with default settings, since the slicer default line width is 0. 2 mm (3 lines) Hot End 210 &#176;C; Bed 60 &#176;C; Print Speed tried between 40 and 100 mm/s; Retraction Distance 6 mm speed 25 mm/s; Print Cooling- Initial 3 layers 0 %, then 100 %, also tried 50 %; I designed this in Tinkercad and sliced it with Cura for the Ender 3 Pro. 45 mm, two perimeters will be 0.
