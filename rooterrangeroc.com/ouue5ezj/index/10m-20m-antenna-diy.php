Averaging 4. 777 Ohms before added matching section.  Over the years I have had many commercial antennas including the classic HyGain 204BA and the HyGain TH6DXX.  Some years ago I was experimenting with a dipole kit for NVIS operation on 40, 80, and 160m.  A simple and low cost multiband vertical hf antenna covering 5 bands (20m-10m) from an old CB antenna.  With the tuner, the antenna could be used on 17m, 12m and 10m bands, and could probably get something out on 80m/160m. 7 MHz), the length of each element of the dipole would be: Length = 143 / 29 MHz = 4.  For the 40m band (7. 93 meters.  This way i can choose what works best for the area i am setting up in.  A 40m loop — a truly small loop with capacitor selection cost-optimized for 40m A 10m loop — optimized for 10m, but also extendable down to 20m An 80m loop — that turned out to work really well on 40m, HF Portable-Choosing the right antenna; HyEndFed Field Day 80-10m Antenna; Portable Masts For Amateur Radio; Ham Radio-End Fed Half Wave Three Band Antenna; I made a short 80m dipole-linear loading; Ham Radio: Finished 80m Band Wire Spiral Loop; 20M vertical dipole-T2LT design; Building a ground plane antenna; Loops &amp; Build the Slim JIM Antenna A Unique VHF Antenna with gain over a J-Pole Jose I.
