Most serious BMW N57 engine problems include overheating, timing chain braking, high oil consumption, and injector issues.  During longer idle phase and low load in diesel particulate filter: Engine running.  They declined my request to be replaced under emission warranty (10 yrs/120k miles).  I have a non starting 118D.  Rail pressure drops and matches the low-pressure fuel pump (85 psi).  In this video I show you the FAILURE of the parts and the references of the commonrail pressure sensor and the commonrail pressure regulator valve of bmw e46.  A high-pressure common-rail injection system from Bosch is employed on the M57.  Connect the pressure gauge as described in the low-pressure test and start the engine until operating pressure is reached.  RPS Failure – The fuel rail pressure sensor, like most semiconductor sensors, is prone to failure from heat and vibration, both of which are present in abundance in the engine compartment.  So, long story short: make sure both your pressure sensors are ok before accusing your DFP. com for sponsoring this video.  On the M57, the rail pressure sensor is screwed onto the end of the rail and on the M67 it is screwed in the distributor block from the bottom to the top. so 4.  Low pressure pump sits under the passenger footwell I think and is fairly cheap/easy to repair.  Some symptoms of an harmonic balancer that needs 1. 31-inch bore, a 3.  (Usually Grade 2-D) • Ice in fuel lines.  Can the fault can be because of the worn out presupply pump?

This causes the car to blast the radiator fan to full power and go into limp mode.  Try increasing the rail pressure, we find injector nozzles that leak at idle pressure, but do not leak at higher pressure.  Install the left side fuel injection fuel rail assembly(3) and heat shield(2).  These issues are directly related to failure of the high pressure fuel pump - or &quot;injection exchange pump&quot; - on popular models such as the 135i, 335i and 535i vehicles.  Vehicle stalling due to exertion or temperature.  Also replace the fuelpump under the driverseat, the fuel pressure before high pressure pump is 5bar.  Low fuel pressure in the fuel system will cause an off-balance air/fuel mixture and that, in turn, causes weak combustion. uk/fuel-rai .  The actual fuel pressure is monitored using the FRP sensor.  Hello to all, I am currently troubleshooting a 320D that has intermittent engine stumbling problems.  Fault Code: 004570.  HP pump failure is rare, LP pump failure is more common and results in symptoms like failing to .  If the engine control module ( ECM) or the powertrain control module ( In practice, many modern common rail injection systems will use both a pressure control valve on the rail and one of the forms of high pressure pump metering to control rail pressure.  Maybe the rail pressure is fine and the signal being sent by the fuel pressure sensor (0-5v) is fine, but the computer interprets it incorrectly.  Dirty or old fuel filter is what gives those faults from experience.  Now, your rail pressure at 296bar - I take it this is at idle.  Fortunately, the fuel system in a car requires only minor tweaks. &quot; Then see if rail pressure will reach 21,000 PSI at idle, if it does then the low rail pressure under a heavy load is usually caused by a bad high pressure pump.
