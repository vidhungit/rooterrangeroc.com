To produce an image, Stable Diffusion first generates a completely random image in the latent space.  It works by starting with a random image (noise) and gradually removing the noise until a clear image emerges‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑.  Been playing with less stable prompts the last few days and the small difference between each sampler is resulting in chaos theory in practice. 2.  Here's our guide on running SDXL v1.
