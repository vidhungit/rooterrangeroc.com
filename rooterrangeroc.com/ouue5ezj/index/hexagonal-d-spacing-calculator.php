This is the distance between successive, parallel planes of atoms.  However for BCC, interplanar spacing of (111) ( 111 .  The orientation of a surface or a crystal plane may be defined by considering how the plane (or indeed any parallel plane) intersects the main crystallographic axes of the solid.  Tetragonal Lattices have two distinct sides which are termed as a and c (a=c means it is cubical).  You can figure out the plant spacing for your gardens and hedgerows using this plant spacing calculator. 12A. c.  It is easy to see how plane faces can develop along some directions and not others if one assumes that the new faces must follow a linear sequence of points.  In 1912, Max von Laue, at the University of Munich in Germany, postulated that atoms in a crystal lattice had a regular, periodic structure with interatomic distances on the order of 1 &#197;.  If the space lattice is SC, the lattice constant is given by the formula a = [2 x r].  2)/ a.  Figure 1.  d-spacing is defined as the distance between adjacent planes.
