Linq Module Module1 Sub Main () Dim numbers () As Integer = {5, 10, 1} ' Take first two numbers from ordered query.  The numbers which are greater than particular value is checked using where function.  public static void Example () { int val = &quot;foo&quot; &gt;= &quot;bar&quot;; } lowValueString = &quot;3&quot;; highValueString = &quot;10&quot;; var sampleData = BuildSampleEntityString (1, 3, 10, 11, 12, 15); var query = sampleData.  In lambda expressions, the lambda operator =&gt; separates the input parameters on the left side from the lambda body on the right side. Name, Products = prodGroup }; A group join produces a hierarchical result sequence, which For more information about the behavior of this method, see the Remarks section of the Compare(String, String) method.  lets say 716).

The First () method returns the first element of a collection, or the first element that satisfies the specified condition using lambda expression or Func delegate.  I've read that it's unwise to use ToUpper and ToLower to perform case-insensitive string comparisons, but I see no alternative when it comes to LINQ-to-SQL. ToDateTime) again, these two operations cancel each other.  Let us see an example to Understand how we can use the LINQ Average Method along with the Where Extension Method in C# using both Method and Query Syntax.  When constructing a filter string, keep these rules in mind: Use the logical operators defined by the OData Protocol Specification to compare a property to a value.  Sorting using standard List methods or linq is simple enough, but since these are text strings, I'm drawing a blank on figuring out how to take all values after a specific filter since you can't us a greater-than sign in your where clause.

There is a restricted set of Functions supported in Linq to Entities.  If your use-case requires the comparison using string objects then:.  Dim result = ( From n In numbers Order By n).  Less than zero: If the value of the current instance is less than the value of target. M_Position class QueryVMethodSyntax { static void Main() { int[] numbers = { 5, 10, 8, 3, 6, 12}; //Query syntax: IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; numQuery1 = from num in numbers where num % 2 == 0 orderby num select num; Linguistic comparisons Comparisons using specific cultures Show 3 more You compare strings to answer one of two questions: &quot;Are these two strings equal?&quot; or Column collation (same as database collation by default) determines the collation of that column.
