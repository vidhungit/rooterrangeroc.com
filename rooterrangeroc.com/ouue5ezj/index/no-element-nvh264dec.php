I see FFMPEG has it called &quot;h264_cuvid&quot; maybe a wrapper can be done for it to save time and not develop it from . 04, however, it will be the same for 20. 264 video streams using NVIDIA's hardware Multiple RTSP streaming using nvcodec fails.  For example using appsrc a CUDA video processing application could send it's image buffers into gstreamer to be encoded, and then retrieve the H. glib. 04.  as of right now if you try to transcode something with NVidia's GPU you must use CPU to decode, can't take advantage of GPU's decoder. GError: no element &quot;x264enc&quot; Apparently the module was not installed: gst-inspect x264enc No such element or plugin 'x264enc' After that I installed the codec the streaming side starts fine with no issues and the clock is running.

IN CASE OF no alpha mask input (all 0's or all 1's), the 'face' downstream event is used to create a bbox of PR_FG elements.  Please upgrade to a recent 1.  By using different decoder elements for each stream's custom pipeline, you can distribute decoding work across multiple GPUs.

For example, if you had fifteen video streams and three GPUs, you might consider having the first five use nvh264dec , the next five use nvh264device1dec , and the final five use nvh264device2dec .  the pipeline state changes from READY to PAUSED just after the latency event; the pipeline state changes from PAUSED to PLAYING just after the source receive the latency event, ie just before the sink receives the first frame.  &gt; Hi Everyone! &gt; &gt; I'm completely new to GStreamer so sorry about probably doing stupid things! &gt; :) &gt; &gt; My goal is to learn if the omx h264 Hardware decoder for my raspberry Pi 4 &gt; works in GStreamer.
