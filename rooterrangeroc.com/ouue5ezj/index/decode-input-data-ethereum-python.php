Our first step is to get the transaction summary by passing the transaction hash to Web3’s get_transaction()method. decode_abi (types, log ['data']) that decodes the data from the arguments types. auto import Web3 import asyncio import json # enter your web socket node credentials here # Step 1: RLP encode an array of the basic transaction inputs.  When Dapps interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain via Web3 RPC calls, the function names, parameters, and return values are encoded as hex values according to the ABI specification.  For installation and getting started requirements see the Web3 documentation.  It is the most important part of transactions, especially for contract transactions.

Under the hood, the logic for decoding transactions now needs to account for &quot; typed transactions ,&quot; which were introduced to Ethereum in the .  That said, as long as You are almost there! The main issue is that you are using the wrong contract and tx data in this example.  You can split the array by the total byte length of the first struct rounded up to a multiplier of 32 - the slot length - and then decode each chunk separately.  Step 1: Construct contract abi (the interface of a contract) EthTx is an open source decoder of blockchain transactions that is made freely available to the Ethereum Community as a Python library in public PyPi index ( project page ).  so the data begins 320 bytes from the start, and thus it is 640 hex characters along, or 10 rows along.

Ethereum Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for users of Ethereum, the decentralized application platform and smart contract enabled blockchain.  Input data is the data field in the transaction object, which is the encoded data of method name and params. db.  and creates a Chain object with the data saved in env.  It seems to be a problem with the abi belonging to the contract you're interacting with, since the code works successfully on, example these hashes (randomly selected from ethscan): The JSONRPC returns the data field hex-encoded and the decode_abi function expects binary data, so you need to decoded the data field before calling decode_abi.  I have the function signature to decode the input with.  res = eth_abi.  1 Answer.  Token transfer details: Value: (2657829493000000000000,) python.  The transaction you are trying to decode is to PancakeSwap V3, but you are using the V2 router address (and ABI probably); also, the tx data looks different than the data in BSCscan.  By default, the decoder will raise an exception if So the expected transformed value of the input data [1] should be 25 or 25 * 10^18 (in wei) or at least any multiple of 25*10^x.  In other words, I'd like to know if it exists a function that given a smart contract address and the data of the transaction, returns the decoded data (the path of all the smart contract addresses that the transaction executes). py Installed.  The first 4 bytes of the keccak-256 hash of the borrow (address,uint256,uint256,uint16,address) function is: Input Data Decoder. contract (address = Decoding Solidity Return Type uint256 using Python web3.  value = decode ( ['uint256'],log ['data']) ouptput.
